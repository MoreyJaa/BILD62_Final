    "# Cellular Automaton for a simulation of vaccine efficacy\n",
    "\n",
    "''' The basis of this algorithm comes from this paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04153#MOESM1\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------Concept-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "    There exists a grid, 90x60 (3:2 aspect ratio is pretty).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Each cell in the grid has three states:\n",
    "        uninfected\n",
    "        infected, contagious\n",
    "        infected, non-contagious\n",
    "        \n",
    "        -infected cells are more saturated the higher viral load they contain.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    A cell can spread to each of its neighbors described by a radius n (simulates lockdowns; fewer neighbor contact).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Cases can worsen at the end of each generation, after spreading is calculated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Virus class needs two peices of data to construct an effective simulation:\n",
    "        -value 'R0' represents the effective reproductive number; essentially how many other people are infected on average.\n",
    "        -value 'k' represents the dispersion parameter; how variable R0 is.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The person class is a shell that needs to distinguish between vaccinated and unvaccinated (base) child classes.\n",
    "        -attribute 'Rt', which calculates it's current reproductive probability.\n",
    "        -A person has an attribute 'viral_load'. Higher viral load increases Rt (R0 at given time t).\n",
    "            -After N generations, a person is considered to be non-contaigous.\n",
    "        -attribute 'tolerance', when viral_load > tolerance at end of generation, cell dies.\n",
    "          \n",
    "    **Vaccinated Person: probability of breakthrough case, resistance constant for viral load calculation.\n",
    "        \n",
    "-----------Math-----------\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Poisson distribution is the probability of x independent event occurrences in Î», the mean occurrence per interval\n",
    "    -Not a good fit for disease spread, models a homogenous population.\n",
    "    -One use: Poisson(R0)=Z (the expected secondary case number at nth percentile = Z^n); Identify SSE (super spreader events).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Inverse Square Law, while usually reserved for physics, is a way to simulate the decrease of viral load over distance.\n",
    "    -This is because this simulation has no enviroment to create enviromental variables.\n",
    "        Amount is proportional to 1/D^2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Negative Binomial Formula: With x trials, results in r successes, and probability of success P:\n",
    "\n",
    "        b*(x; r, P) = x-1Cr-1 * Pr * (1 - P)x - r   OR    { (x-1)! / [ (r-1)!(x-r)!] } * Pr * (1 - P)x - r\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The geometric distribution is a type of negative binomial distribution...\n",
    "        -with 'x' as the number of trials required for a single success, and P the probability of success: g(x; P) = P * Qx - 1\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "-----------Implementation-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "1st Goal: create a working spread model, no vaccinated persons, use binary numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "*NON EDGE CASES:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Each infected cell generates a random percentage S (spread), influenced by its viral load. \n",
    "    Each infected cell also generates an Rt, using k and R0.\n",
    "    Poisson(Rt) is calculated for all x, 0-N(max neighbors).\n",
    "    Infected neighbors are chosen by distance using Z = int(Poisson(Rt)==S) # rounding\n",
    "    One generation is simulated; tolerance influences viral load, using a geometric distribution\n",
    "    Cells that have been infected for K weeks can no longer infect\n",
    "    Cells with low enough viral load lose the sickness.\n",
    "    Non-Contagious cells are marked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    RULESET:\n",
